What is redisU?
redisU is a free open source client for Redis 2.2.10 that can be used with Unity3d. redisU is designed keeping in mind that unity uses .NET 2.0 or a subset of .NET 2.0 to compile the source code. Hence, redisU only uses those classes and data types that are available in .NET 2.0 or lower.

redisU is currently under development and will be constantly updated. However, the compiled binary available to downlaod is a stable release.
